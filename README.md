About

My name is Prateek Barve, as a Business Analytics graduate from Babson College with a passion for data-driven solutions, I bring a blend of technical expertise and creative problem-solving skills to the table. With a track record of leveraging tools like Python, Tableau, and R to extract actionable insights, I've demonstrated my ability to drive business growth and enhance operational efficiency. From conducting market research to developing machine learning algorithms, I'm committed to delivering tangible results that make a meaningful impact.

During my Master's I have honed my skills and also gained some new skills such as Statistical Analysis, Data Management, Machine Learning etc. which would be helpful in my next venture as a Data Analyst
